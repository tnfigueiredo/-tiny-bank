# ADR 01: Use Docker Services to Present Project Documentation

## Context and Problem Statement

In order to provide a friendly environment to navigate through the documentation, it was chosen a stack of Docker 
services provided through a docker-compose.yml file. Those services will allow to navigate in the documentation, and 
in the application itself.

## Considered Options

1. Allow the user to find a tool to visualize the documents by himself.
2. Provide an environment to allow a friendly visualization for the documents.

## Decision Outcome

The option 2 was the chosen solution. This option is better for documentation and project usability.
