# ADR 03: Use BDD to Document and Test Requirements

## Context and Problem Statement

In order to allow a description of the requirements with the scope being covered by the application, it was necessary 
to choose an approach to write the requirements and its scenarios for the project.

## Considered Options

1. Write markdown files having the user stories and the acceptance criteria.
2. Use some framework integrated to the source code to produce the requirements and acceptance criteria documentation.

## Decision Outcome

It was chosen the option 2. This decision was taken because it could be possible to link the test scenarios to the 
application source code, and for being familiar wit an initial basic setup to run an application using this approach.
