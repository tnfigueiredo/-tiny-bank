# ADR 02: Use MkDocs to Present the Markdown Content

## Context and Problem Statement

In order to provide a friendly environment to automatically navigate in the markdown documentation and enable the 
decision taken in the ADR01, it was necessary to choose an environment to present the markdown documentation.

## Decision Outcome

It was chosen a container image for the [MkDocs project](https://www.mkdocs.org/). It was not considered other options. 
The MkDocs was chosen for being familiar with the basic project setup settings, for allowing to keep the project and documentation simple.
